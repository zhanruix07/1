All your results should be presented by now, and all that remains is that you discuss them. You should always be critical of your results, and if they are not in correspondence with your theory presented in section \ref{sec:problem_description} this should be elaborated on! Why is there a mismatch between those two? What could have gone wrong and what do these non-correspondences imply? If there are undiscussed results, do not neglect them! It is easily seen and it doesn't look good in the report. Good reports really stand out from bad ones in this section and you can shine through if you have a well thought through reflection here.
